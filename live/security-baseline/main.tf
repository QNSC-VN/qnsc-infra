# security-baseline — account-wide audit & threat-detection baseline.
#
# One stack, applied once per account, that gives the platform its management-
# plane audit trail and detective controls (SOC 2 CC7.x / enterprise baseline):
#   - CloudTrail  — multi-region trail, log-file validation, KMS-encrypted, to a
#                   locked, versioned, TLS-only S3 bucket.
#   - AWS Config  — records all resource config + a core set of managed rules.
#   - GuardDuty   — continuous threat detection.
#   - Access Analyzer — flags resources shared outside the account.
#
# Additive only — provisions no product resources and touches nothing the
# bootstrap/product stacks own. Uses its own dedicated audit CMK (not the
# platform CMK) so it never has to reach into the bootstrap key policy.

# RDS Protection — OFF, and this is a cost decision taken with the exposure in view.
#
# GuardDuty enabled RDS_LOGIN_EVENTS automatically and ran it on the 30-day free trial.
# The trial expired 2026-08-12: `APS1-FreeRDSvCPUMonitored` went to $0 and
# `APS1-PaidRDSvCPUMonitored` began billing the same day, reaching $2.28/mo within a week
# and still climbing — it bills per vCPU MONITORED, so it grows again when rally
# production runs its database 24/7 rather than idled. Left alone it is roughly $5/mo,
# and it was 82% of GuardDuty's entire bill.
#
# WHAT IT DETECTS: anomalous login behaviour against RDS — brute force, logins from
# unusual principals or geographies.
#
# WHY THE EXPOSURE IS SMALL HERE, stated so this can be re-argued rather than re-guessed:
#   - No RDS instance is publicly accessible. All three sit in data subnets with no
#     internet route, reachable only from the app security group and the SSM bastion.
#   - Credentials are per-role and least-privilege (db_least_privilege in the product
#     stacks): api and worker connect as rally_app / rally_worker, neither of which can
#     DROP a schema. The master credential belongs to the migrator alone.
#   - CloudTrail still records every API-level action against RDS, and that is what an
#     audit asks for. This feature is network/behavioural detection on top.
#
# WHAT IS NOT AFFECTED: the rest of GuardDuty stays on — CloudTrail, DNS, VPC flow logs,
# S3 data events and EBS malware protection are all still enabled above and cost $0.50/mo
# between them.
#
# TURN IT BACK ON IF: an RDS instance is ever made publicly accessible, the bastion is
# opened beyond the current IAM-gated SSM path, or a compliance obligation names
# database-login monitoring specifically. It is one line and takes effect immediately.
#
# Declared explicitly rather than switched off in the console, so the console cannot
# quietly re-enable it and so the reason travels with the setting.
