# =============================================================================
# organization — RETIRED 2026-08-18. DO NOT APPLY.
#
# THE ORGANIZATION THIS STACK MANAGES NO LONGER EXISTS. It was deleted on 2026-08-18 so
# that account 608983206583 could join a partner's organization (TrueIDC) to evaluate Kiro.
# An AWS account belongs to at most one organization, so deleting this one was the only
# route in.
#
# WHAT THAT COST, recorded here because it is not obvious from the outside: IAM Identity
# Center lives in an organization's MANAGEMENT account, so it went with the org. A MEMBER
# account cannot enable Identity Center, so `aws sso login` is gone for this account and
# cannot be restored while it belongs to someone else's org. Human access was rebuilt in
# live/security-baseline/human-access.tf — an IAM user with no permissions that assumes a
# role with MFA. Read that file's header before changing anything about access.
#
# WHAT DID NOT BREAK: nothing operational. GitHub Actions authenticates through the OIDC
# provider in iam-oidc, never through Identity Center, so all thirteen `*-github-*` roles
# kept working across the deletion — confirmed by a Terraform plan that ran and read S3
# state afterwards.
#
# APPLYING THIS WOULD CREATE A NEW ORGANIZATION with 608983206583 as its management
# account, which would FAIL while the account is a member of another org — and if it ever
# succeeded it would silently undo the partner-billing arrangement. It is deliberately not
# referenced by .github/workflows/infra-apply.yml, so CI cannot reach it. Keep it that way.
#
# THE REMOTE STATE AT platform/organization/terraform.tfstate IS ORPHANED. It still
# describes the deleted organization, its OUs, its SCPs and its permission sets. It is left
# in place rather than deleted because it is the only record of what that topology was, and
# because deleting state is irreversible in a way that keeping it is not. Do not run
# `tofu destroy` here: the resources are already gone and the run would only mislead.
#
# KEPT, NOT DELETED, on purpose. If the account ever leaves the partner org, this stack is
# the fastest route back to a governed baseline: Organizations with feature set ALL, the
# Security / Shared-Services / Workloads OUs, the baseline SCPs in scp.tf, and Identity
# Center in identity-center.tf. Rebuilding that from memory would be a week's work and the
# SCPs in particular encode decisions nobody would reconstruct correctly.
#
# TO REVIVE IT: leave the partner org, wait for the account to become standalone, delete
# the orphaned state file, then apply from scratch. The `enable_identity_center` variable
# is the switch that brings SSO back, and doing so should retire human-access.tf.
#
# ── Original header follows, describing the design as it was ─────────────────
#
# organization — AWS Organizations landing-zone root (management account).
#
# The identity & governance foundation for the whole platform. Adopt NOW at $0,
# single-account — the account split (dev/prod member accounts) is deferred per
# COST_POSTURE_PLAN.md §8, but the free layer beneath it is not:
#   - AWS Organizations (feature set ALL) + service-access principals
#   - OUs matching the ACCOUNT_SPLIT_PLAN topology (Security / Shared-Services /
#     Workloads) — empty today, ready for member accounts at the split trigger
#   - Baseline Service Control Policies (region-lock, deny-disable-logging,
#     deny IAM-user/access-key creation, deny root, deny leave-org)
#   - IAM Identity Center (SSO) permission sets — the human access model
#     (opt-in via enable_identity_center; humans use SSO, never IAM users/keys)
#
# Additive & isolated: provisions no product resources, owns nothing the
# bootstrap / security-baseline / product stacks own. This stack runs in the
# MANAGEMENT account only.
#
# ⚠ Bootstrap order & import: enabling Organizations + Identity Center is a
# one-time console/CLI action (needs management-account admin). If the org
# already exists, import it before the first apply:
#     tofu import aws_organizations_organization.this <org-id>
# See README.md for the full runbook and the SCP lockout-safety notes.
